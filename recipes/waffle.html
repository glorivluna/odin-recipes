    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chaffles are an overnight sensation in the low carb/keto world. Adding almond flour gives them a more traditional waffle texture and helps get rid of any eggy taste. Seriously, try them, they're delicious! I use an inexpensive mini waffle maker (such as DashÂ® Mini Maker Waffle) which produces perfect 4-inch chaffles. So many ways to use chaffles, the sky's the limit!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon blanched almond flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together egg, almond flour, and baking powder. Stir in mozzarella cheese and set batter aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        <li>Spray both sides of the preheated waffle iron with cooking spray. Pour 1/2 of the batter onto the waffle iron and spread it out from the center with a spoon. Close the waffle maker and cook until chaffle reaches your desired doneness, about 3 minutes. Carefully lift chaffle out of the waffle iron and repeat with remaining batter. Allow chaffles to cool for 2 to 3 minutes, and they will begin to crisp up.</li>
